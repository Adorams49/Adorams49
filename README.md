- 👋 Hi, I’m @Adorams49
- 👀 I’m interested in learing programming languages, data structures and algorithms but also in creating games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python since lots of people say it's the best language to start learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other people that are also learning.
- 📫 You can reach me at adorams49@gmail.com
